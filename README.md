# HexGridder
A website to generate dynamic hex grids, hosted with Github Pages. Useful for game development planning (hopefully).

## GitHub Pages Link
[https://jordanbird.github.io/HexGridder/](https://jordanbird.github.io/HexGridder/)

## Development
The only requirement is a sass compiler. Currently HexGridder uses [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), which if installed can be started using startsass.bat in /scss/.

## Contributing
To contribute simply submit a pull request.
